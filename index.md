title: Maven Package Type For FirstSpirit Modules
---

# Welcome!

Since Maven supports only standard files types such as JARs (*.jar), WARs (*.war), ... there is no 
build-in support for FSMs (*.fsm) which are used by FirstSpirit

## More information

How to use the Maven package type for FSMs is documented at the GitHub repository at 
[github.com/zaplatynski/fsm-packagetype](https://github.com/zaplatynski/fsm-packagetype).

## Disclaimer

FirstSpirit is a trade mark by the [e-Spirit AG](https://www.e-spirit.com).
